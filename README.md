AI-based Diagnosis Plants Diseases Platform

The main goal of this platform is to expedite adoption of Artificial intelligence(AI) in agriculture by providing a new AI-based Diagnosis Plants Diseases Platform called GreenCare.AI. This AI platform provides users a tool kit to build intelligent applications (such as GreenCareUnit : AI-based mobile application, and GreenCareMonitering : AI-based Decision making monitoring system), which are cost-effective technically, suitable for use in small, rural and desert farms, as well as for large scale farms, prairies and forest. Thus, to build an autonomous capacity for farmers to treat plants diseases.
